# Data Visualisations Evaluation and Redesign  

## Overview  
This repository contains two case study assessments that critically evaluate and redesign data visualisations. The focus is on applying principles of storytelling, genre, and effective communication in data visualisation. Each case study highlights strengths and weaknesses of the original visualisations and proposes improvements that enhance clarity, accessibility, and audience engagement.

## Case Studies  

### Case Study A
Focuses on two visualisations sourced from online platforms:  
- A **Minecraft server death statistics bar chart**  
- A **celebrity divorce settlement lollipop chart**  

The analysis evaluates audience, action suitability, structure, and aesthetics. Recommendations include clearer labelling, improved chart titles, reducing clutter, and better use of icons and scales to make the data more intuitive.  

### Case Study B
Evaluates a larger set of 10 visualisations, identifying three recurring issues:  
1. **Overcomplicated visuals** that overwhelm the reader.  
2. **Unclear or poorly chosen labels** that reduce interpretability.  
3. **Ineffective colour choices** that hinder accessibility.  

The chosen redesign focuses on a UK map of colloquial game names, suggesting simplification (showing only dominant terms), better label placement with pointers, legend adjustments, and adoption of colourblind-friendly palettes.  

## Purpose  
These case studies demonstrate the application of data visualisation principles taught in MXB262, including:
- Storytelling with data  
- Annotated and comparative chart design  
- Use of colour, layout, and pre-attentive attributes  
- Audience-driven design choices
