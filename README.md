# • Data Visualisations Evaluation and Redesign  
*Based on Case Studies*

## Overview  
This repository contains two case study assessments that critically evaluate and redesign data visualisations. The focus is on applying principles of storytelling, genre, and effective communication in data visualisation. Each case study highlights strengths and weaknesses of the original visualisations and proposes improvements that enhance clarity, accessibility, and audience engagement.
